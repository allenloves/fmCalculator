fmCalculator
============

Welcome to the fmCalculator!

FM Calculator is a simple tool for composers who are interested using FM spectrum to generate pitch sets, chords, or other musical materials. You can find first release here:

https://github.com/allenloves/fmCalculator/releases/tag/0.1

For now I only have release for mac version.  The source code is very easy and should be able to compile for PC or Linux.  I will put on more functions later once I figured out how to do it.  :)
